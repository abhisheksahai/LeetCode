In interview first do with brute force O(n*N), using inbuild sorting o(n * log n) and finally o(n)

Glassdoor and BlindApp (Register with current company) In blind app real interview questions were mentioned

Pascal triangle: (Utilize the properties of binomial coefficients to calculate each element in the k-th row directly.)
long currentElement = prev * (rowIndex - i + 1) / i;


Example 1: Apple US
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0

Solve with brute force and try with two pointer in O(N) as well
